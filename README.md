### A suite of libraries for making game development with Three.js and React not only awesome, but "so good, it would feel wrong to use anything else." ‚Äì [hmans](https://github.com/sponsors/hmans)

Building games with React and Three.js is already pretty cool, but a lot of tooling you need to make those games _really nice_ is still missing. This project tries to fill some of these gaps by providing a collection of libraries for various aspects of game development, from **GPU-driven particle systems and VFX**, to **game UI**, **editor tooling**, **camera rigs**, **audio**, **multi-device input**, and more.

> **Note**
> While this suite of libraries targets building games with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React-Three-Fiber], some of them can also be used outside of React, just like some others are not specific to Three.js or React-Three-Fiber. But building games with React is where our hearts are at, which is why you will find most example code in this document to be written in React. üòé

## Packages üì¶

[![Shader Composer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1061/187867434-1e8bc952-8fed-4e17-afc6-fca97951ba1a.jpg)](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/shader-composer)  
![react] ![vanilla] ![three]

**[Shader Composer]** takes a graph of nodes (here called "units") and compiles it to a working GLSL shader. It provides a library of ready-to-use shader units, but you can, of course, add your own. Parameterized sub-graphs of your shaders can be implemented as plain JavaScript functions.

```jsx
const ShaderComposerExample = () => {
  const shader = useShader(() =>
    ShaderMaterialMaster({
      color: pipe(
        Vec3(new Color("red")),
        (v) => Mix(v, new Color("white"), NormalizePlusMinusOne(Sin(Time()))),
        (v) => Add(v, Fresnel())
      )
    })
  )

  return (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry />
      <shaderMaterial {...shader} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

[![material-composer-thin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1061/187885049-cdbbd4c6-b974-4214-a0de-916d9ee412bb.jpg)](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/material-composer)  
![react] ![vanilla] ![three]

**[Material Composer]** provides a mechanism to hook into Three.js materials and customize their behavior using a sequence of material modules. Modules are higher-level implementations of Shader-based functionality, and implemented using [Shader Composer]. Material Composer provides a library of these material modules that are easy to extend and customize; but, as always, you can add your own.

```jsx
const MaterialComposerExample = () => (
  <mesh position-y={1.5} castShadow>
    <sphereGeometry />

    <Composable.MeshStandardMaterial>
      <Modules.Color color="#d62828" />

      <Layer opacity={NormalizePlusMinusOne(Sin(Time()))}>
        <Modules.Color color="#003049" />
      </Layer>

      <Modules.Fresnel intensity={0.2} />
    </Composable.MeshStandardMaterial>
  </mesh>
)
```

[![VFX Composer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1061/187867928-5cac4fa9-908c-4c78-93de-2a9ac3998dbd.jpg)](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/vfx-composer)

![react]

**[Timeline Composer]** provides a small, but powerful collection of React components that can be used to orchestrate an animation sequence:

```jsx
<Lifetime seconds={5}>
  <SmokeRing />
  <Fireball />

  <Delay seconds={0.3}>
    <CameraShake decay />
    <Fireball />

    <Delay seconds={0.2}>
      <Rocks />
      <SmokeCloud />
    </Delay>
  </Delay>
</Lifetime>
```

## Development üõ†

### Core Tenets

All of the libraries in the Composer Suite are aiming for the following:

- **Authored in and for TypeScript**.  
  All libraries are authored in TypeScript, with first-class type support. This means that you can use these libraries in JavaScript, but you will get the best experience when using TypeScript. If you're using them from within JavaScript, please be aware that these libraries will not make any significant effort to provide runtime type checking or similar.
- **Flawless HMR**.  
  The libraries should provide a fun and flawless development experience with the best support for hot-module reloading possible. The user should be able to hot-reload their code and see the changes immediately in the browser. Where possible, state should be retained; there must never be errors when hot-reloading.
- **Prefer Declarative over Imperative**.  
  Where possible, allow the user to declare logic and data using JSX, instead of forcing them out of the declarative JSX layer and towards hooks (or even further into the imperative world.)
- **Usable Individually, and Together**.  
  Where possible, libraries should be designed so they can be used individually, but also together.
