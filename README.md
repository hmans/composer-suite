> **Note**
>
> This suite of libraries is primarily targeted at building games with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React-Three-Fiber]. Some of these libraries can be used outside of React, just like some others are not specific to Three.js or React-Three-Fiber, but you will find most example code to be written in React.

## Sponsors ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project wouldn't be possible without the support from its lovely [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hmans). If you'd like to sponsor this project and help **make game development with React & Three.js incredible**, [click here](https://github.com/sponsors/hmans)!

## Packages üì¶

[![Shader Composer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1061/187867434-1e8bc952-8fed-4e17-afc6-fca97951ba1a.jpg)](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/shader-composer)  
![react] ![vanilla] ![three]

**[Shader Composer]** takes a graph of nodes (here called "units") and compiles it to a working GLSL shader. It provides a library of ready-to-use shader units, but you can, of course, add your own. Parameterized sub-graphs of your shaders can be implemented as plain JavaScript functions.

```jsx
const ShaderComposerExample = () => {
  const shader = useShader(() =>
    ShaderMaterialMaster({
      color: pipe(
        Vec3(new Color("red")),
        (v) => Mix(v, new Color("white"), NormalizePlusMinusOne(Sin(Time()))),
        (v) => Add(v, Fresnel())
      )
    })
  )

  return (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry />
      <shaderMaterial {...shader} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

**[Material Composer]** provides a mechanism to hook into Three.js materials and customize their behavior using a sequence of material modules. Modules are higher-level implementations of Shader-based functionality, and implemented using [Shader Composer]. Material Composer provides a library of these material modules that are easy to extend and customize; but, as always, you can add your own.

```jsx
const MaterialComposerExample = () => (
  <mesh position-y={1.5} castShadow>
    <sphereGeometry />

    <composable.meshStandardMaterial>
      <modules.Color color="#d62828" />

      <Layer opacity={NormalizePlusMinusOne(Sin(Time()))}>
        <modules.Color color="#003049" />
      </Layer>

      <modules.Fresnel intensity={0.2} />
    </composable.meshStandardMaterial>
  </mesh>
)
```

![react]

**[Timeline Composer]** provides a small, but powerful collection of React components that can be used to orchestrate an animation sequence:

```jsx
<Lifetime seconds={5}>
  <SmokeRing />
  <Fireball />

  <Delay seconds={0.3}>
    <CameraShake decay />
    <Fireball />

    <Delay seconds={0.2}>
      <Rocks />
      <SmokeCloud />
    </Delay>
  </Delay>
</Lifetime>
```

## Development üõ†

### Core Tenets

- **Authored in and for TypeScript**.  
  All libraries are authored in TypeScript, with first-class type support. This means that you can use these libraries in JavaScript, but you will get the best experience when using TypeScript. If you're using them from within JavaScript, please be aware that these libraries will not make any significant effort to provide runtime type checking or similar.
- **Flawless HMR**.  
  The libraries should provide a fun and flawless development experience with the best support for hot-module reloading possible. The user should be able to hot-reload their code and see the changes immediately in the browser. Where possible, state should be retained; there must never be errors when hot-reloading.
