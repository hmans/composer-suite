"@material-composer/patched": patch
---

`Patched.*` now exposes both lower and upper case versions of the materials, so `Patched.meshStandardMaterial` will work just as well as `Patched.MeshStandardMaterial`. Note: the lower-case version should be considered deprecated, and will likely be removed in a future update.
