# Audio Composer

## Summary

High-level audio composition primitives for games built with React-Three-Fiber. Heavily WIP!

## Goals / Roadmap

- [x] Wrappers for the basic Three.js audio primitives (`AudioListener`, `PositionalAudio`, `Audio`)
- [x] Primitives for procedurally generating sound effects
- [x] A JSX API for composing filter chains et al
- [ ] A nice API or pattern for wet/dry in effects
- [ ] Integrate/rebuild Three's positional audio primitives to be integrated with our setup a little closer
- [ ] Find a nice JSX API for ramping values
- [ ] Find a nice JSX API for controlling what a node connects to
