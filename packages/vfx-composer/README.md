## Introduction üëã

**VFX Composer is a visual effects library for [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [@react-three/fiber]** (through the [vfx-composer-r3f](https://github.com/hmans/vfx-composer/tree/main/packages/vfx-composer-r3f) package.) It allows you to build complex visual effects in a declarative way, compiling them into shaders using the [Shader Composer] library. All your VFX execute on the GPU.

VFX Composer's main exports are:

#### Particles üéÜ

A highly optimized particle system engine based on THREE.InstancedMesh. It can use any geometry for its particles, and is typically coupled with a **VFXMaterial** instance that will animate them.

#### VFXMaterial üé®

A custom material that can be used to render a visual effect. It accepts a list of **effect modules** which are compiled into a single shader. VFXMaterial happily extends Three's built-in materials, from THREE.ShaderMaterial to THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial, and can even inject its shaders into materials loaded from eg. GLTF files.

#### A Library of Effect Modules üéÅ

Effect modules are functions that transform positions, colors, opacity and other attributes. They can be chained toegther to create complex effects, and make use of [Shader Composer] to compile a complete effect into a single shader. VFX Composer provides a library of immediately usable effect modules, but you can also implement your own.
