### Patch Changes

- 6fbe89d: **Breaking Change:** The `maxParticles` prop of `Particles` and `<Particles>` has been renamed to `capacity`. Also, `safetyBuffer` has been renamed to `safetyCapacity`, and will now default to 10% of the capacity unless specified otherwise. (Fixes #172)

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c4ef849: **Added:** Partial attribute buffer uploads! Now only the parts of the buffers that have been used for newly spawned particles are actually uploaded to the GPU.
- ea13985: **Breaking Change:** Upgrade to the latest Shader Composer and Material Composer. Lots of new APIs! Aaaah! Please refer to the examples for guidance.
- cd19781: **Changed:** `<Emitter>` now applies its world transform to spawned particles, meaning you can parent it to other scene objects for easy-peasy particle trails.
- f8b4c05: **Changed:** A complete refactoring around a new imperative/vanilla core. Enjoy!
- dc04f03: `VFXMaterial` and the animation modules have been extracted into a new package, **Material Composer**, that this library now uses as a dependency.
- c09304e: All the react-three-fiber specific bits that were formerly available at `vfx-composer/fiber` now live in a separate `vfx-composer-r3f` package.

### Patch Changes

- 2d867ec: **Added:** `<Emitter>` will now retrieve the parent `<Particles>` via context if none is specified explicitly.
- bfd1588: **Fixed:** `<Emitter>` could no longer work with `<Particles>` refs passed into its `particles` prop. Woops!

- a11c4b7: **Breaking Change:** The `Lifetime` module was replaced by the `Particles` module, which takes the object returned from `createParticleUnits` as props.

### Patch Changes

- a11c4b7: `vfx-composer/units` now exports `createParticleUnits`, a helper that creates the necessary Shader Composer units for managing particle lifetimes.
