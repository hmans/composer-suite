# shader-composer

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 70025cb: The `GradientStop` and `GradientStops` generics now default to `vec3` gradients.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 85941bb: Added `InstanceID` and `VertexID` units.
- 60a3bcf: Added `float` cast, which will cast the given expression to a float unit.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 9e693e9: In `CustomShaderMaterialMaster`, only write to `csm_Roughness` and `csm_Metalness` when the shader is used within a MeshStandardMaterial or MeshPhysicalMaterial.
- 04549bc: Added new `GradientStops<T>` type to clean up the signature of `Gradient` a little bit.

## 0.3.0

Woohoo, it's a shiny new release! First of all, if you're reading this, then you're either me, or you're crazy, or possibly both! While 0.3.0 is the first release where I consider Shader Composer to be **feature complete**, things are still in a relative amount of flux, and will remain so for the next few releases. Why are you using this already?! You're brave, and I salute you!

This release contains a plethora of **new unit implementations**, some great new **API refinements**, but a couple of minor **breaking changes** (please see the notes below.)

The focus for the next release is on cleanup, restructuring (expect breaking changes!), and finally some documentation. I've set up a tracking issue for this, [tag along for the ride](https://github.com/hmans/shader-composer/issues/101)!

### Breaking Changes

- 104be03: **Breaking Change:** `Uniform` is now called `UniformUnit`. The r3f package's `useUniform` is now `useUniformUnit`.
- 847b42f: **Breaking Change:** Removed the `variable` configuration setting for units. You were probably not using it, and it really only existed to give uniform units a chance to not attempt to create `sampler2D foo = u_foo` variables (which is not allowed in GLSL.) The uniform issue being handled differently now, and this feature has been removed, further simplifying the compiler code.
- b571299: **Breaking Change:** The unit returned by `Time()` has been simplified. You can now access the uniform's value through `Time().value` (before it was `Time().uniform.value`.)
- a4739b1: **Breaking Change:** The `Input<T>` type started out named `Value<T>`, and we've kept around a type alias for that to not break existing code. This `Value` type has now been removed; please use `Input`.

### Minor Changes

- 847b42f: `compileShader` now returns `dispose` function as part of its second return value (in the same object that houses the `update` function). The user is expected to invoke this method when the shader is no longer needed.

  When using `useShader` from `shader-composer-r3f`, this will be done automatically.

  Similarly, units can now implement their own `dispose` functions (analogous to their `update` functions). These will be unvoked when the user invokes the `dispose` function returned by `compileShader`.

- 847b42f: The signature of the units' optional `update` function has been extended to include not only `dt` (the deltatime), but also, in that order, `camera` (a reference to a Three.js camera), `scene` (a reference to the scene being rendered), and `gl` (a reference to the `WebGLRenderer` instance doing the rendering.)

  The same change was made to the `update` function returned by `compileShader`. If you are using Shader Composer with vanilla Three.js, you are expected to pass all of these arguments to the function:

  ```js
  const [shader, { update }] = compileShader(root)

  /* In your render loop */
  update(dt, camera, scene, gl)
  ```

  If you are using `shader-composer-r3f`, this is done automatically for you, using the active scene and the current default camera.

- 1155845: Added `UsingInstancing`, a boolean unit that is true when instanced rendering is being used.
- b945b21: Simplified the implementation of `Remap`. Also added `remap()` as a function that returns a remapping expression.
- 847b42f: Added `FragmentCoordinate`, a fragment-program only unit that returns the `vec2` coordinate of the fragment that is currently being shaded. It wraps the `gl_FragCoord` built-in variable.
- 847b42f: Added `RawDepth` and `PerspectiveDepth`, two units that will read depth values from a provided sampler2D unit containing a depth texture. The user is expected to generate this texture in a pre-render pass.

- 847b42f: Added `InstanceMatrix` to wrap the `instanceMatrix` attribute provided by Three.js. Please note that this is only available when instanced rendering is active.
- 847b42f: Added `ModelViewMatrix` to wrap the `modelViewMatrix` uniform provided by Three.js.
- 847b42f: Shader Composer's standard library now provides the new and/or improved units `Resolution`, `CameraNear` and `CameraFar`.

  `Resolution` is a `vec2` uniform unit containing the current render resolution, and is automatically updated from the `WebGLRenderer` instance passed into the shader's `update` function.

  `CameraNear` and `CameraFar` are `float` uniform units that contain the current camera's near and far planes, respectively, and are automatically updated from the `Camera` instance passed into the shader's `update` function.

### Patch Changes

- b945b21: Added `Lerp`, which is equivalent to `Mix`, and `InverseLerp(a, b, c)`, which returns the lerping ratio of `c` within `a` and `b`. Also added equivalent `lerp` and `inverseLerp` expressions that can be used directly without wrapping the resulting values in Units.
- a4739b1: Added the `varying(i, config?)` helper that will wrap the given input value in a new unit that is configured to use a varying. It's a neat little shortcut for quickly configuring existing values to be scoped to the vertex program, and made available to the fragment program via a varying.
- 48f1880: Fixed a bug where using a vector unit's `.x`, `.y` etc. accessors would result in the original unit being included in the shader twice.
- 3563f33: The `vec2`, `vec3` and `vec4` helpers now use a default value of `0` for each of their components.
- a4739b1: Added new `unit(i)` cast helper. If `i` is already a unit, it will be returned; if not, it will be wrapped in a unit of the same type.
- 8ea045c: Added `Gradient`, a unit that samples a value from a gradient defined as a range of stops:

  ```jsx
  const color = Gradient(
    heat,
    [new Color("#03071E"), 0],
    [new Color("#03071E"), 0.3],
    [new Color("#DC2F02"), 0.5],
    [new Color("#E85D04"), 0.6],
    [new Color("#FFBA08").multiplyScalar(2), 0.8],
    [new Color("white").multiplyScalar(2), 0.9]
  )
  ```

- 847b42f: Added `localToViewSpace` and `localToWorldSpace`, two functions returning expressions that convert the given vec3 or vec4 input to the respective space (by multiplying it with the correct matrices.)

  Also added `LocalToViewSpace` and `LocalToWorldSpace`, which are unit implementations wrapping these expressions.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 252fe37: `CustomShaderMaterialMaster` now supports `emissiveColor`.

## 0.2.0

This release contains a lot of new unit implementations, some useful new convenience features, an upgrade to how uniforms work, and a big, big number of internal refactorings and simplifications. But also some breaking changes, so let's start with those!

### Breaking Changes

- 9cedc98: **Removed:** removed `With` math builder. It was experimental and not very good. You probably weren't using it, anyway. If we really want something like this, it should live in `toybox` or another separate package, anyway.
- bb9b9c9: **Removed:** The second value returned by `compilerShader` no longer includes the `units` property. Please use the `walkTree` and `collectFromTree` functions to inspect the unit tree.
- dc7bac6: **Removed:** The export `VertexNormalWorld` has been removed. If you need The vertex normal in world space, you can now use `VertexNormal.world`, or calculate it yourself by multiplying `VertexNormal` with `ModelMatrix`.

### New Units

- 298f5f1: **Added:** `Rotate3DX`, `Rotate3DY`, `Rotate3DZ` and `Rotate3D`, units that will immediately rotate a given vector (unlike `Rotation3DX`, `Rotation3D` etc., which just generate matrices representing the rotations.)
- c5df072: **Added:** `Exp`, `Exp2`, `Log` and `Log2`
- c214c76: **Added:** `Dot`, a unit that calculates the dot product of two vectors.
- 4abb089: **Added:** `Tan(a)`, wrapping the GLSL expression `tan(a)`
- 8559c99: **Added:** `Asin`, `Acos`
- 5b64d3c: **Added:** `Trunc`, a new unit wrapping the GLSL `trunc` function.
- 901ff79: **Added:** `Min(a, b)` and `Max(a, b)`.
- 05bbe5f: **Added:** `Distance(a, b)`, returning the distance (`float`) between `a` and `b`.
- 0d9261f: **Added:** `Length`, `Reflect` and `Refract`
- c9e35d9: **Added:** `Sqrt` and `InverseSqrt`
- f071317: **Added:** `Sign(a)`, wrapping the GLSL expression `sign(a)`.
- 3447459: **Added:** `Radians(a)` and `Degrees(a)`.
- 9277d9f: **Added:** `Abs` unit, returning the absolute value of the given input.

### Other new bits

- 094b196: **Added:** Units with uniforms now have a new configuration property `uniformName` which can be set by the user to explicitly configure the name of the shader uniform. If the name is omitted, a unique name will be generated automatically (as before).
- 42b0798: **Added:** Vec2/3/4 units now expose `.x`, `.y`, `.z`, `.w` accessors for their components, so you can now, for example, directly refer to `UV.x` or `VertexNormal.z`. Sorry, no swizzling support -- _yet_! :-)
- 3990c13: **Added:** `VertexPosition` and `VertexNormal` now expose `.world` and `.view` properties, returning the position/normal in world or view space, respectively.
- 6201363: **Added:** `CustomShaderMaterialMaster` now supports `roughness` and `metalness` inputs (supported by CSM 3.5.0 and up.)

### Fixes

- ba000d6: **Fixed:** `Fresnel` now uses the vertex normal _in world space_ if no other normal input is provided.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- 41c92e8: **Added:** `Time` now takes an optional argument `n` that will be used as the initial value of the time uniform.
- 41c92e8: **Added:** `Time().uniform` is now available as a reference to the uniform used by the `Time` unit. This allows you to source (or even change) the uniform's value in JS.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- a8466f2: **Fixed:** `CustomShaderMaterialMaster` now correctly sources the base material's texture map if one is given.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 48c25c8: **Fixed:** `CustomShaderMaterialMaster` no longer overrides colors coming from the base material if no `diffuseColor` or `fragColor` inputs are specified.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- f9aa82b: **Added:** new `mat3(v)` and `mat4(v)` helpers -- they simply cast the given value `v` to their respective types.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 9f527d7: **Changed:** The `Value` type is now officially called `Input`, but an alias to `Value` is still being exported for the time being. This alias will be removed in a future minor/major version.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 3350f94: **Fixed:** `vec4` values were not rendering correctly in GLSL. Ouch!
- 8b55c9c: **Added:** `collectFromTree`, which returns all items from the given tree matching a specific condition.
- 3350f94: **Added:** `Rotation3DX(angle)`, `Rotation3DY(angle)`, `Rotation3DZ(angle)` and `Rotation3D(axis, angle)` units returning transformation matrices expressing the specified rotation. (Multiply your positions etc. with them to apply them!)
- 3350f94: **Fixed:** `mat3` and `mat4` values were not rendering _at all_ in GLSL. Woops!

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 0c0f413: `walkTree` now includes constant values (numbers, Vector and Color instances, etc.) in its traversal.
- b70b206: Reverse order in which `walkTree` traverses the graph.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 39524d2: Add `getDependencies`, a utility function that returns the dependencies of the given unit, expression, or snippet.
- 39524d2: Adds `walkTree`, a utility function that takes a graph item (unit, expression, or snippet), and then walks the dependency tree starting at that item, invoking a callback function for every item encountered.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 74e6d2a: **Breaking Change:** The return signature of `compileShader` has been changed. It now returns `[shader, meta]`, where `shader` is the object containing the shader properties (like before), and `meta` is an object containing the `update` function, and a `units` array containing all units used in the tree.

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 0514bca: Added `Attribute` unit, for accessing geometry attributes, and automatically making their values accessible to the fragment shader by way of a varying.

  ```js
  const color = Attribute("vec3", "color")
  ```

- 61d7881: Also re-export `flow` from fp-ts. Thank you, fp-ts!

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- f57f58e: New logo! Yay!

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- 267d8a2: Re-export `Clamp01` as `Saturate`, because that's how people call it in that other tool.
- 5622611: Add `OneMinus` unit.

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- eb25ba8: Added `Round`, `Fract`, `Floor`, `Ceil` and `Module` units.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- b59783e: Unit values can now be set to `undefined`. This is useful in units that are guaranteed to source their actual value in one of the shader chunks, or through a uniform.
- b59783e: The `Time` unit now is a constructor, meaning that you need to invoke `Time()` instead of just using `Time` directly. This also means that right now, multiple invocations of `Time()` will create multiple time uniforms that will get updated separately, so it is advised that you create a single instance of this unit and then reuse that in your shader where needed:

  ```ts
  const time = Time()
  ```

- b59783e: Uniforms now generate their own names, so you can now create a new uniform like this:

  ```ts
  const uniform = Uniform("vec3", new Vector3())
  ```

- b59783e: `Sampler2D` is gone; in its stead, you can now just use a `Uniform` with the `sampler2D` type. Example:

  ```ts
  const sampler2D = Uniform("sampler2D", texture)
  const tex2d = Texture2D(sampler2D)
  ```

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 4ae847a: Export `glslType` from shader-composer.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 61458c3: Removed `withAPI`. It is no longer needed; just mix in your favorite properties, getters, setters etc. into the units you're creating.
- 61458c3: **Better Uniform support!** The `Uniform` unit will now automatically register its uniform value objects with the material (so you no longer have to do it yourself). It also exposes a `value` getter/setter that you can use to update or otherwise interact with the uniform's value.
- ea71657: Shader Composer now re-exports the extremely useful `pipe` from `fp-ts`.
- 61458c3: Moved `value` and `type` into `_unitConfig` to make room for nicer user-facing APIs.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- ae36751: Remove `JoinVector2/3/4`. The new `vec2/3/4` helpers do the same thing (but better.)
- ca37b48: Introduce `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` helpers as an alternative syntax to their capitalized counterparts. Yes, there are now three ways to construct vectors (`Vec3`, `vec3` and `JoinVector3`), and that's not great. We will eventually consolidate these in a future version.
- c2157ff: We're trying prereleases! Let's go!
- c90ab60: Force high precision in all shaders. (This will be made configurable in a future update.)

## 0.0.4-next.2

### Patch Changes

- ae36751: Remove `JoinVector2/3/4`. The new `vec2/3/4` helpers do the same thing (but better.)
- c90ab60: Force high precision in all shaders. (This will be made configurable in a future update.)

## 0.0.4-next.1

### Patch Changes

- ca37b48: Introduce `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` helpers as an alternative syntax to their capitalized counterparts. Yes, there are now three ways to construct vectors (`Vec3`, `vec3` and `JoinVector3`), and that's not great. We will eventually consolidate these in a future version.
