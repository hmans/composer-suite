## Summary

Write Three.js shaders, but with JavaScript! âœ¨

> **Warning**
>
> This library is still relatively new. I'd love for you to give it a go and maybe provide some feedback, but I would currently recommend **strongly** against using it in any sort of production project, unless you're ready and willing to keep up with the changes every release. **Use at your own risk.**

## Projects using Shader Composer

- **[VFX Composer](https://github.com/hmans/vfx-composer)**, a visual effects-focused GPU particles runtime for Three.js.

## Examples & Sandboxes

- **[Official Examples App](https://shader-composer-examples.vercel.app/)** ([CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/hmans/shader-composer), [Source Code](https://github.com/hmans/shader-composer/tree/main/apps/examples/src/examples))

## Questions and Answers

#### Where is the documentation?

I want to wait for things to stabilize some more before sitting down to write documentation. For the time being, please take a look at the [examples provided within this repository](https://github.com/hmans/shader-composer/tree/main/apps/examples/src/examples). (Or open them in a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/hmans/shader-composer)!)

#### Does this reimplement Three.js's built-in materials?

No, but you can inject your custom shaders created with this library into Three.js's built-in materials through the provided `CustomShaderMaterialMaster` and [three-custom-shader-material]. And of course you can also just use it with `THREE.ShaderMaterial` like you would with any other custom shader.

#### Does this work with WebGPU, WebGL, ...?

Currently, only WebGL (GLSL) is supported, but adding support for WebGPU and WGSL is definitely possible and has a good chance of happening at some point.

#### Where is the node editor? I was expecting a node editor!

Shader Composer is a code-first library, and there is no intention for it to provide a graphical node-based editor (although it is certainly possible to do so, and maybe someone will eventually build one. Any takers? :D)

#### Why are the graphs constructed from "units" and not "nodes"?

Because I wanted this library to be a little more unity.
